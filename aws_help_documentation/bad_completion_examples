Vector2 towards = GetClosestPlayer().transform.position;
# prompt:
// set facing to look at the player
# result:
if (towards.x < transform.position.x)
{
    transform.localScale = new Vector3(-1, 1, 1);
}
# problem: this will flip the direction whenever i am to the left of the player, instead of looking at him.
# correct answer:
if ((transform.position.x - towards.x) * math.sign(transform.localScale.x) < 0)
{
    transform.localScale = new Vector3(-1, 1, 1);
}
